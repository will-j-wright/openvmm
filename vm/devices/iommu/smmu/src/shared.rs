//! Shared SMMU state and per-device translation wrappers.
//!
//! [`SmmuSharedState`] holds the SMMU configuration that per-device wrappers
//! need for translation: stream table base, CR0 state, and a reference to
//! guest memory for walking page tables.
//!
//! [`SmmuTranslator`] implements
//! [`IommuTranslator`](iommu_common::IommuTranslator), translating IOVAs to
//! GPAs via the SMMU page tables. The generic
//! [`TranslatingMemory`](iommu_common::TranslatingMemory) in `iommu_common`
//! provides the [`GuestMemoryAccess`] boilerplate.
//!
//! [`SmmuSignalMsi`] implements [`SignalMsi`], translating the MSI address
//! (which may be an IOVA) to a GPA before forwarding to the inner MSI
//! target.
//!
//! [`SmmuIrqFd`] implements [`IrqFd`](vmcore::irqfd::IrqFd), producing
//! [`SmmuIrqFdRoute`] instances that translate the MSI address on
//! [`enable`](vmcore::irqfd::IrqFdRoute::enable) before forwarding to the
//! inner irqfd route.
