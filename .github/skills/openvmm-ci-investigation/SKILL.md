# Investigating CI Failures

When a PR has failing CI checks, **always start by running the investigation
script**. Do not manually query the GitHub API or download artifacts by hand
— the script handles all of that automatically.

## Step 1: Run the Script

```bash
# Investigate the current branch's PR (no argument needed)
python3 repo_support/investigate_ci.py

# Investigate a specific PR by number
python3 repo_support/investigate_ci.py 2946

# Or by run ID directly
python3 repo_support/investigate_ci.py 23017249697
```

The script automatically:
1. Resolves the PR to **every** failed CI run for its head commit. A commit
   can have multiple workflows (e.g. "OpenVMM PR" and "OpenVMM Docs PR"),
   and each failing one is investigated in turn — so don't assume a single
   run covers everything. Only the newest run of each workflow is used, so
   superseded runs are ignored; a `NOTE: <workflow> is still in_progress`
   line means results are incomplete and more failures may appear later.
2. Identifies failed jobs
3. Downloads `*-unit-tests-junit-xml` artifacts and parses JUnit XML for
   unit test failures
4. Downloads `*-vmm-tests-logs` artifacts if they exist
5. Finds tests with `petri.failed` markers and extracts ERROR/WARN lines
6. If no test or JUnit artifacts exist (build/fmt/clippy failure), shows the
   tail of the failed job's log

## Step 2: Analyze the Script Output

Read the script's output to identify:
- Which tests failed (unit tests and/or VMM tests)
- Error messages and root causes
- Whether it's a build/fmt/clippy failure vs. a test failure

When more than one run failed, the output is split by `# RUN n of m` banners.
Check **all** of them — a docs failure and a build failure are reported in
separate runs.

Then use the information to diagnose the issue and suggest fixes.

## Step 3: Diagnose from Logs and Code

**Always try to diagnose the failure from CI logs, test code, and error
messages first.** Most failures can be understood without local reproduction.
Read the relevant test source, trace the error through the code, and form
a hypothesis before considering local repro.

## Step 4: Reproduce Locally (Only If Needed)

If you cannot diagnose the failure from logs alone, **ask the user** whether
they want to attempt local reproduction before proceeding. Do not
automatically start building or running tests on the user's machine.

If the user agrees, check whether the failing platform matches the host
architecture — you can only reproduce tests locally on the same arch. If
it doesn't match, explain this to the user and continue diagnosing from
CI logs and test code.

To reproduce locally, load the `vmm-tests` skill for instructions on
running with `cargo xflowey vmm-tests-run`. Do **not** use
`cargo nextest run -p vmm_tests` directly — it won't have the required
artifacts.

## Reference: Manual Commands

> **Only use these if the script fails or you need to dig deeper into a
> specific artifact.** In normal usage, the script above is sufficient.

If the script isn't available or you need more control, follow these steps:

### 1. Find the failing run

```bash
# Get the run ID for a PR
gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> -R microsoft/openvmm
# Or list runs for a specific commit
gh run list -R microsoft/openvmm --commit <SHA>
```

### 2. Identify the failing job

```bash
gh run view <RUN_ID> -R microsoft/openvmm --json jobs \
  -q '[.jobs[] | select(.conclusion == "failure") | {name, databaseId}]'
```

### 3. Download test artifacts

**Unit test results** are stored in JUnit XML artifacts named
`{platform}-unit-tests-junit-xml`. Known platforms include:
- `x64-linux`
- `aarch64-linux`
- `aarch64-linux-musl`

```bash
# Download unit test JUnit XML for a platform
gh run download <RUN_ID> -R microsoft/openvmm \
  -n aarch64-linux-unit-tests-junit-xml -D /tmp/junit-xml
# Parse failures from the XML
python3 -c "
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET, sys
for f in __import__('pathlib').Path(sys.argv[1]).rglob('*.xml'):
    for tc in ET.parse(f).iter('testcase'):
        fail = tc.find('failure')
        if fail is None:
            fail = tc.find('error')
        if fail is not None:
            print(f'FAIL: {tc.get(\"classname\",\"\")}::{tc.get(\"name\",\"\")}')
            print(f'  {fail.get(\"message\",\"\")[:200]}')
" /tmp/junit-xml
```

**VMM test results** are stored in artifacts named `{platform}-vmm-tests-logs`.
The known platforms are:
- `x64-windows-intel`
- `x64-windows-intel-tdx`
- `x64-windows-amd`
- `x64-windows-amd-snp`
- `x64-linux`
- `aarch64-windows`

```bash
# Download a specific platform's test logs
gh run download <RUN_ID> -R microsoft/openvmm \
  -n x64-windows-amd-snp-vmm-tests-logs -D /tmp/test-logs
```

### 4. Find failed tests

Each test gets its own directory inside the artifact. Look for `petri.failed`
marker files (passing tests have `petri.passed` instead):

```bash
find /tmp/test-logs -name "petri.failed"
```

The `petri.failed` file contains the error petri recorded for the test. The
test's real name is in `petri.test`, which petri writes before the test body
runs — so a directory with `petri.test` but *no* result marker is a test that
was killed or crashed before it could report.

### 5. Extract errors from petri.jsonl

The `petri.jsonl` file in each test directory is the primary structured log.
Each line is a JSON object with fields: `timestamp`, `source`, `severity`,
`message`. Filter for `ERROR` and `WARN` severity for a quick diagnosis:

```bash
python3 -c "
import json, sys
for line in open(sys.argv[1]):
    try:
        e = json.loads(line.strip())
        if e.get('severity') in ('ERROR', 'WARN'):
            print(f'[{e[\"severity\"]}] {e.get(\"source\",\"?\")}: {e.get(\"message\",\"\").strip()[:200]}')
    except: pass
" /tmp/test-logs/<test-dir>/petri.jsonl
```

## Artifact Contents

### Unit test JUnit XML

Artifacts named `{platform}-unit-tests-junit-xml` contain JUnit XML files
with `<testcase>` elements. Failed tests have `<failure>` or `<error>`
children with `message` attributes describing the failure. These are the
primary artifacts for diagnosing unit test / cargo-nextest failures.

### VMM test logs (petri)

Each test directory contains:
- `petri.jsonl` — Structured JSON Lines log **(primary file for investigation)**
- `petri.log` — Plain text version of the test log
- `petri.test` — The test's name, written before the test body runs
- `petri.passed` or `petri.failed` — Pass/fail marker; a failure marker holds the error
- `openhcl.log` — OpenHCL serial console output, if the test exercised OpenHCL
- `hyperv.log` — Hyper-V event log, if the test exercises the Hyper-V backend
- `openvmm.log` — OpenVMM serial console output, if the test exercises the OpenVMM backend
- `guest.log`, `uefi.log` — Guest OS serial output
- Sometimes: `screenshot_*.png` — periodic screenshots of the guest
- Sometimes: `dumpfile.dmp`

## Viewing Results in Browser

Test results are uploaded to Azure Blob Storage and viewable at:

## Common Failure Patterns

- **Unit test failure**: A `unit tests` job failed. The script downloads
  JUnit XML artifacts and shows the failing test names and messages. Common
  causes: new test code that relies on OS capabilities not available in CI
  (e.g. TAP devices, elevated permissions).
- **Formatting / house-rules**: The `quick check [fmt, clippy x64-linux]` job
  failed. No test artifacts will exist. Run `cargo xtask fmt --fix` locally
  and check the job log for the specific rule that failed.
- **Docs failure**: A job in the separate "OpenVMM Docs PR" workflow failed —
  either `build mdbook guide` (broken Guide markdown/links; mdbook logs
  `[ERROR] (mdbook::...)`) or `build and check docs` (rustdoc warnings, which
  are denied in CI). Reproduce with `cargo doc --no-deps -p <package>`.
  No test artifacts will exist.
- **TripleFault**: VM hit a fatal error during boot. Check `petri.jsonl` for
  Hyper-V Worker/Chipset errors. Often infrastructure-related, not caused by
  the PR's code changes.
- **Timeout**: Test exceeded its time limit. Check if the VM booted at all.
- **Guest assertion failure**: Guest-side test failed. Check `guest.log`.
- **Build failure**: No test artifacts will exist. Check the job log directly
  with `gh run view <RUN_ID> --job <JOB_ID> --log`.

## Important API Note

The `gh run view --json artifacts` flag does **not** exist. To list artifacts
for a run, use the GitHub API directly:

```bash
gh api repos/microsoft/openvmm/actions/runs/<RUN_ID>/artifacts
```
