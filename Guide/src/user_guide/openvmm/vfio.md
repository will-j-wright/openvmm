# VFIO Device Assignment

This page explains how to assign a physical PCI device to an OpenVMM guest using Linux VFIO.

VFIO device assignment lets a guest VM directly access a physical PCI device (such as an NVMe controller or GPU). The guest sees the real device in its PCI bus and can interact with its config space.

```admonish warning
VFIO device assignment is experimental. PCI config space, BAR MMIO passthrough, MSI-X interrupts (via irqfd), and DMA are functional. Devices such as NVMe controllers work end-to-end.
```

## Overview

OpenVMM running on a Linux host can assign physical PCI devices to guest VMs using VFIO. The device is bound to the `vfio-pci` kernel driver, then OpenVMM opens it via VFIO and presents it to the guest as a PCIe endpoint.

The guest sees the device's real config space with some filtering applied:
each assigned device appears as a single-function device (the multi-function
bit is cleared), and certain PCIe extended capabilities are hidden because they
don't make sense in a virtual topology. Currently filtered extended
capabilities are SR-IOV, ARI, and Resizable BAR.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux host with IOMMU support enabled (Intel VT-d or AMD-Vi)
- A PCI device available for passthrough
- The `vfio-pci` kernel module loaded
- The `vfio_iommu_type1` kernel module loaded

## Step 1: Identify the device

Find the PCI device you want to assign:

```bash
lspci -D
```

Look for the device's PCI address in `domain:bus:device.function` format, for example `0000:01:00.0`.

## Step 2: Enable unsafe interrupts

Some IOMMU implementations do not support interrupt remapping. If VFIO fails to set up the IOMMU with an "interrupt remapping" error, allow it to proceed without:

```bash
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/module/vfio_iommu_type1/parameters/allow_unsafe_interrupts
```

```admonish note
This flag is required in environments where the IOMMU does not support interrupt remapping (e.g., some nested virtualization setups). The "unsafe" label means a device could theoretically forge interrupt messages. In practice, this is acceptable when the host platform already constrains device behavior.
```

To make this persistent across reboots, add a modprobe config:

```bash
echo "options vfio_iommu_type1 allow_unsafe_interrupts=1" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf
```

## Step 3: Bind the device to vfio-pci

If the device is currently bound to another driver (e.g., `nvme`), unbind it first:

```bash
echo "0000:01:00.0" | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:01:00.0/driver/unbind
```

Then bind to `vfio-pci`:

```bash
echo "vfio-pci" | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:01:00.0/driver_override
echo "0000:01:00.0" | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/bind
```

Verify the binding:

```bash
ls -la /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:01:00.0/driver
# Should show: ... -> ../../../../bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci
```

```admonish warning
If the device is an NVMe controller backing a mounted filesystem, unbinding it will cause data loss. Make sure you are not using the device before unbinding.
```

## Step 4: Verify VFIO group

Check that a VFIO group device was created:

```bash
ls /dev/vfio/
```

You should see a numbered group (e.g., `/dev/vfio/0`). An IOMMU group is required — NoIommu mode is not supported.

## Step 5: Launch OpenVMM with the VFIO device

Use the `--vfio` flag to assign the device to a PCIe root port. You also need to create a PCIe root complex and root port for the device to attach to:

```bash
sudo openvmm \
  --pcie-root-complex rc0 \
  --pcie-root-port rc0:rp0 \
  --vfio host=0000:01:00.0,port=rp0 \
  --kernel /path/to/vmlinux \
  --initrd /path/to/initrd \
  --cmdline "console=ttyS0" \
  --com1 console \
  --memory 256M \
  --processors 2
```

The `--vfio` value is a comma-separated list of `key=value` pairs:

- `host=<pci_bdf>` (required) — the PCI BDF of the VFIO device on the host (e.g., `0000:01:00.0`)
- `port=<name>` (required) — the name of the PCIe root port to attach the device to (must match a `--pcie-root-port` name)
- `iommu=<id>` (optional) — reference to an `--iommu` context; see [Using iommufd (cdev path)](#using-iommufd-cdev-path) below
- `bar0=host` through `bar5=host` (optional) — pin the specified BAR to its
  physical host address (GPA = HPA); see [Peer-to-peer DMA](#peer-to-peer-dma)
  below
- `bar0=0x<addr>` through `bar5=0x<addr>` (optional) — pin the specified BAR
  to an explicit host physical address; use this for BARs synthesized by a
  VFIO variant driver whose address is not reported through sysfs

```admonish tip
You can assign multiple devices by adding more root ports and `--vfio` flags:

    --pcie-root-port rc0:rp0 \
    --pcie-root-port rc0:rp1 \
    --vfio host=0000:01:00.0,port=rp0 \
    --vfio host=334c:00:00.0,port=rp1
```

### Using iommufd (cdev path)

By default, `--vfio` uses the legacy VFIO group/container interface with the
Type1v2 IOMMU driver. On hosts with Linux kernel 6.6 or newer, OpenVMM can
instead use the modern VFIO cdev (per-device fd) + iommufd interface. Enable
it by declaring an `--iommu` context and referencing it from each `--vfio`
device with the `iommu=` key:

```bash
sudo openvmm \
  --pcie-root-complex rc0 \
  --pcie-root-port rc0:rp0 \
  --iommu id=iommu0 \
  --vfio host=0000:01:00.0,port=rp0,iommu=iommu0 \
  ...
```

The `--iommu` syntax is `id=<name>`. All `--vfio` devices that reference the
same `id` share a single iommufd IOAS (one set of IOMMU page tables and one
DMA mapper registration). The IOAS is allocated on demand the first time a
device referencing the id is opened.

Devices opened via the cdev path read their device node from
`/sys/bus/pci/devices/<pci_id>/vfio-dev/vfioN` and open
`/dev/vfio/devices/vfioN` instead of `/dev/vfio/<group>`.

## Step 6: Verify in the guest

If the guest boots with PCI support, the assigned device should be visible:

```bash
lspci
```

The device will appear with its real vendor and device ID from the physical hardware.

## Peer-to-peer DMA

Normally, peer-to-peer (P2P) DMA between two passthrough devices works
via ATS (Address Translation Services): each device translates DMA
addresses through the IOMMU, so guest BAR placement doesn't matter.

Some platforms — notably NVIDIA GB200 and GB300 — do not support ATS in
their root complex. On these machines, P2P DMA between devices (e.g., GPU
and NIC) works by disabling ACS on the physical PCIe switch so that TLPs
route directly between devices without going through the IOMMU. Since
there is no translation layer, the devices use raw physical addresses for
P2P DMA. This means the guest BAR addresses must be identity-mapped to
the host BAR addresses (GPA = HPA), or P2P DMA will target the wrong
location.

To enable this, pin the relevant BARs with `bar<N>=host` on each `--vfio`
device and set `preserve_bars` on the root complex so the PCI resource
allocator keeps pinned BARs at their physical addresses:

```bash
sudo openvmm \
  --pcie-root-complex \
    rc0,preserve_bars,low_mmio_base=0xc0000000,high_mmio_base=0x100000000 \
  --pcie-root-port rc0:rp0 \
  --pcie-root-port rc0:rp1 \
  --vfio host=0000:01:00.0,port=rp0,bar0=host \
  --vfio host=0000:02:00.0,port=rp1,bar0=host \
  ...
```

For a BAR synthesized by a VFIO variant driver, the host physical address may
not appear in the device's sysfs resource table. In that case, provide the
address directly with `bar<N>=0x<addr>`. For example, the `nvgrace-gpu` driver
exposes CPU-coherent GPU memory as a synthetic 64-bit BAR4 whose physical base
comes from the `nvidia,gpu-mem-base-pa` ACPI `_DSD` property:

```bash
  --vfio host=0008:06:00.0,port=rp0,bar0=host,bar2=host,bar4=0x110000000000
```

The `low_mmio_base=` and `high_mmio_base=` options pin the MMIO apertures
to fixed addresses so the allocator can place both pinned and dynamic BARs
correctly.

## Optional: use hugetlb-backed guest RAM

For large VMs, VFIO DMA setup can be much faster when guest RAM is backed by
Linux hugetlb pages. Without hugetlb backing, the kernel may have to pin each
4 KB page individually during `VFIO_IOMMU_MAP_DMA`. With 2 MB or 1 GB hugetlb
pages, the same mapping work is performed over far fewer pages.

Hugetlb pages must be reserved on the host before starting OpenVMM. For
example, reserve enough 2 MB pages for a 64 GB VM:

```bash
echo 32768 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages
```

For 1 GB pages, reserve pages through the size-specific sysfs pool:

```bash
echo 64 | sudo tee \
  /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-1048576kB/nr_hugepages
```

Then request hugepage-backed RAM with the `--memory` option:

```bash
sudo openvmm \
  --pcie-root-complex rc0 \
  --pcie-root-port rc0:rp0 \
  --vfio host=0000:01:00.0,port=rp0 \
  --kernel /path/to/vmlinux \
  --initrd /path/to/initrd \
  --cmdline "console=ttyS0" \
  --com1 console \
  --memory size=64GB,hugepages=on,hugepage_size=2MB \
  --processors 16
```

Use `hugepage_size=1GB` to request 1 GB pages. If `hugepage_size` is omitted,
OpenVMM uses 2 MB pages.

```admonish note
Hugepage-backed RAM is Linux-only. It cannot be combined with file-backed
memory, private memory (`shared=off`), or legacy x86 RAM splitting such as
PCAT firmware.
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No such file or directory" for `/dev/vfio/*`

Make sure you completed Step 2 (allow unsafe interrupts) and that the device is bound to `vfio-pci`. An IOMMU must be available — NoIommu mode is not supported.

### "No interrupt remapping" / ENODEV on IOMMU setup

Run Step 2 to enable `allow_unsafe_interrupts`. This is needed when the platform's IOMMU does not support interrupt remapping.

### "failed to open VFIO device" / permission denied

Run OpenVMM with `sudo`, or add your user to the `vfio` group and set appropriate permissions on `/dev/vfio/` devices.

### Device not visible in guest `lspci`

- Verify the device is bound to `vfio-pci` (Step 3)
- Verify the VFIO group exists in `/dev/vfio/` (Step 4)
- Verify the `--vfio` port name matches a `--pcie-root-port` name
- Check OpenVMM log output for errors during VFIO device initialization

### Hugepage allocation fails

If OpenVMM fails while allocating guest RAM with `hugepages=on`, verify that
the host has enough free pages in the requested hugetlb pool:

```bash
grep -i Huge /proc/meminfo
```

For 1 GB pages, also check the size-specific pool:

```bash
grep . /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-1048576kB/*
```

## Current Limitations

- **No save/restore** — VMs with VFIO devices cannot be saved or migrated.
- **No hot-plug** — VFIO devices must be specified at VM creation time and cannot be added or removed while the VM is running.
- **Linux only** — the `--vfio` flag is only available when OpenVMM is built and run on Linux. On Windows, use `--device` with WHP for device assignment.
