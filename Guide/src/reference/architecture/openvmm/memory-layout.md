# Memory Layout

OpenVMM has to decide where every byte of guest physical address space goes:
RAM, MMIO windows for emulated and PCIe devices, paravisor private memory, and
architectural ranges like the LAPIC or GIC. This page describes how those
decisions are made.

```admonish warning title="Compatibility surface"
Guest physical addresses are part of the VM's compatibility contract. Guests
remember device and RAM locations across hibernation, and saved VM state
references them. Changing request order, placement class, or alignment can
move guest addresses and break resume on existing VMs.

Treat layout policy changes like VM ABI changes: a new default may be fine
for new VMs, but existing persisted configuration must continue to resolve
to the same guest physical addresses.
```

## Two pieces

Layout resolution is split into two pieces that you should think about
separately:

1. A **pure address-space allocator** in `vm_topology::layout`. It knows
   nothing about chipsets, firmware, VTLs, PCI, or the host. Callers describe
   what they need in terms of ranges, sizes, alignments, and a placement
   class, and the allocator returns deterministic guest physical addresses.
2. A **worker resolver** in `openvmm_core::worker::memory_layout`. This is
   where OpenVMM's policy lives: which platform ranges are pinned, what
   alignments NUMA nodes get, how PCIe ECAM is sized, and so on. The resolver
   describes the VM to the allocator, runs it, and builds the resulting
   [`MemoryLayout`](https://openvmm.dev/rustdoc/linux/vm_topology/memory/struct.MemoryLayout.html)
   that the rest of the VM worker uses to look up RAM, MMIO, PCI ECAM, and
   PCI MMIO ranges.

Keeping the allocator policy-free means its behavior can be exhaustively
tested in isolation, and the worker can be reasoned about as a list of
requests that fully describes the VM.

## The allocator

[`LayoutBuilder`](https://openvmm.dev/rustdoc/linux/vm_topology/layout/struct.LayoutBuilder.html)
accepts four kinds of input:

| Input | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `reserve(range)` | Block allocation at this address but do not include it in the layout top. |
| `fixed(range)` | A range whose address is already decided. Blocks allocation and counts as part of the layout. |
| `ram(size, alignment)` | Ordinary guest RAM. The only request type that may be split across multiple extents. |
| `request(size, alignment, placement)` | A single contiguous range, placed dynamically. The `placement` chooses one of three phases below. |

`reserve` and `fixed` differ only in how they affect the **layout top** —
the address one past the highest guest-visible byte. `fixed` ranges raise
it; `reserve` ranges do not. This matters because the layout top determines
where post-MMIO requests (such as paravisor private memory) start: a
reserved hole high up in the address space should not push them even
higher.

When `allocate()` runs, it processes requests in a fixed phase order. Each
phase pulls from whatever address space the earlier phases left free:

1. **Reserved ranges** are removed from the free space.
2. **Fixed ranges** are removed from the free space.
3. **`Placement::Mmio32`** requests are packed *top down* below 4 GiB, so
   RAM can start at GPA 0 and grow upward through the lowest free space.
4. **RAM** requests are placed *bottom up*, in caller order, splitting
   around any holes left by the earlier phases. The first request starts at
   GPA 0; each subsequent request starts at or above the highest address
   used by previous RAM requests, so later requests never backfill
   fragments earlier ones skipped. RAM is the only splittable kind.
5. **`Placement::Mmio64`** requests are packed *bottom up* starting at the
   end of RAM. This makes the layout top a function of requested topology
   rather than a precomputed high MMIO bucket size.
6. **`Placement::PostMmio`** requests are placed *after* everything else
   (excluding reserved ranges from the "everything else"). They are for
   ranges that should not affect the guest-visible top of memory.

Within `Mmio32` and `Mmio64`, requests are sorted by alignment (largest
first), then size (largest first), then caller order. This keeps large,
strictly-aligned device windows from being fragmented by small devices.
RAM and `PostMmio` use caller order verbatim: RAM order is the NUMA vnode
assignment, and `PostMmio` carries policy that should not be reordered by
alignment.

```admonish note
The allocator does not take host physical-address width as an input. The
layout is computed as a pure function of VM configuration; the worker
checks the resulting layout top against host capabilities after the fact.
This keeps guest physical addresses from shifting when the same VM moves
to a host with a different physical-address width.
```

## Worker policy

The worker resolver in
[`openvmm_core::worker::memory_layout`](https://github.com/microsoft/openvmm/blob/main/openvmm/openvmm_core/src/worker/memory_layout.rs)
issues requests in this order:

1. **Low-RAM reserve** (`reserve`) — when a nonzero `ram_start_address` is
   requested, the range `0..ram_start_address` is reserved so RAM starts
   above it. This is used on aarch64 Linux direct boot to skip the low GPA
   region that conflicts with the host MSI-doorbell IOVA that iommufd
   reserves. Being a `reserve` (not `fixed`), it blocks allocation without
   raising the layout top.
2. **Chipset low MMIO** (`fixed`) — a window pinned to end at 4 GiB,
   advertised to firmware as `\_SB.VMOD._CRS`. The window always covers
   at least the per-architecture reserved zone (LAPIC, IOAPIC, GIC,
   PL011, battery, TPM, etc.) so guests can arbitrate fixed-address
   children against this window. The caller-requested size may extend it
   lower.

    | Architecture | Minimum range (architectural reserved zone) |
    |---|---|
    | x86_64 | `0xFE00_0000..0x1_0000_0000` |
    | aarch64 | `0xEF00_0000..0x1_0000_0000` |

3. **Chipset high MMIO** (`Mmio64`) — the corresponding high range. 2 MB
   alignment.
4. **PCIe ECAM** (`Mmio64`), one block per PCI segment. Root complexes
   that share a segment are grouped so the segment gets a single
   contiguous ECAM block (keeping the MCFG bus-0 base consistent for every
   RC in the segment), which is then subdivided into per-RC sub-ranges.
   The block size is derived from the segment's combined bus window as
   `(max_bus - min_bus + 1) * 1 MB` (32 devices × 8 functions × 4 KiB per
   config space). ECAM is placed above 4 GiB by default so the low MMIO
   window stays free for devices that require 32-bit addressing. The
   `--pcie-ecam-below-4gb` compatibility option instead places each
   segment's ECAM in 32-bit MMIO for direct-boot kernels that cannot
   discover high ECAM. Every ECAM range must start at or above a fixed
   `256 MiB` minimum: the ACPI MCFG table reports the bus-0 base as
   `ecam_start - start_bus * 1 MiB`, and since `start_bus` is a `u8` up to
   255 MiB of headroom may be required. A resolved ECAM below this minimum
   fails VM construction rather than producing an unrepresentable MCFG
   entry.
5. **PCIe per-root-complex ranges**, one set per root complex:
    - **Low MMIO** (`Mmio32`), 2 MB aligned. A caller can pin this to a
      fixed range instead of supplying a size, for assigned-device, IOMMU,
      and physical-topology passthrough.
    - **High MMIO** (`Mmio64`), 1 GB aligned. A caller can pin this to a
      fixed range as well. Per-BAR alignment would guarantee the entire
      window is usable for one large BAR, but burns address space on
      hosts with tight physical-address widths.
    - **CXL HDM and CHBCR** (`Mmio64`) — when a root complex is CXL-enabled,
      a Host-managed Device Memory window and a Host Bridge Component
      Registers window are placed, each aligned to its CXL-spec size.
6. **Virtio-mmio slots** (`Mmio32`) — one contiguous region sized
   `slot_count * 4 KiB`, when any slots are configured.
7. **IOMMU MMIO** (`Mmio32`) — a VM has at most one IOMMU type; one region
   is placed per configured instance, sized by type: SMMUv3 128 KiB,
   AMD-Vi 16 KiB, Intel VT-d 4 KiB.
8. **RAM**, in vnode order. The first request becomes vnode 0, the second
   vnode 1, and so on. Each vnode starts at or above the highest address
   used by prior vnodes; vnode N+1 never backfills a fragment that vnode
   N skipped. This keeps vnode ordering equal to address ordering and
   turns vnode layout into a clean compatibility surface — adding a new
   fixed or reserved range below RAM end can only shift the first vnode
   whose own span actually covers it. Alignment depends on request size:

    | RAM request size | Alignment |
    |---|---|
    | < 1 GB | 2 MB |
    | ≥ 1 GB | 1 GB |

    Alignment matters because RAM extents that start on a huge-page
    boundary can be mapped with 2 MB or 1 GB huge pages in host and
    guest page tables, avoiding the memory overhead and construction
    cost of thousands of smaller page table entries and reducing TLB
    pressure at runtime. Sub-GB nodes use 2 MB so small NUMA nodes
    do not waste a full GB of address space.
9. **VTL2 chipset MMIO** (`PostMmio`) — VTL2's own VMBus / chipset MMIO
   region, when VTL2 is configured. Placed after VTL0 so enabling VTL2
   does not move any VTL0 address.
10. **VTL2 private memory** (`PostMmio`) — when the IGVM file requests
    layout-mode VTL2 memory, the worker takes only its size and alignment
    from the IGVM relocation header. The IGVM file's relocation min/max
    bounds are not fed in as constraints here; they are validated later by
    the IGVM loader against the selected base. Treating them as constraints
    here would over-constrain layout and could put holes in VTL0 just to
    accommodate an IGVM file we will reject anyway.
11. **VTL2 framebuffer** (`PostMmio`) — a page-aligned region for VTL2
    graphics, when configured. Its resolved GPA base is returned separately
    for the framebuffer device.

After `allocate()` succeeds, the worker collects the resolved ranges into
the `MemoryLayout`'s MMIO, PCI ECAM, and PCI MMIO gap vectors, then checks
the highest placed-range address (which includes VTL2 private memory and
VTL2 chipset MMIO) against the host's physical-address width.

## RAM splitting

RAM is the only splittable request. When contiguous free space is
available, the full requested size is placed at an aligned start address
— alignment constrains where the extent starts, not how large it is. A
1.5 GB request with 1 GB alignment in open space produces a single
`[0, 1.5 GB)` extent with no wasted space.

Splitting only happens when a fixed or reserved range interrupts the free
space. In that case the alignment also acts as the **split granularity**:
partial chunks are rounded down to the alignment before continuing. This
keeps every RAM extent on a huge-page boundary so the host and guest can
use large pages (reducing page table overhead and TLB pressure), and
avoids sub-alignment fragments that would complicate the NUMA and
compatibility surface.

The practical effect is that 1 GB-aligned RAM stays in 1 GB-aligned
chunks. A small fixed hole just above the 1 GB boundary will not cause a
"nearly 1 GB" RAM extent to be placed in the interrupted range; instead,
RAM resumes at the next 1 GB boundary.

## Examples

These examples use compact synthetic configurations. Each one is covered
by tests in `vm_topology::layout` or `openvmm_core::worker::memory_layout`.

### A fixed MMIO range splits RAM

4 GB of RAM with a 1 GB fixed MMIO range from 1 GB to 2 GB:

| Input | Range |
|---|---|
| RAM request | 4 GB |
| Fixed MMIO | `0x4000_0000..0x8000_0000` |

| Output | Range |
|---|---|
| RAM | `0x0000_0000..0x4000_0000` |
| MMIO | `0x4000_0000..0x8000_0000` |
| RAM | `0x8000_0000..0x1_4000_0000` |

Total RAM is still 4 GB — the fixed range is occupied address space, not
RAM.

### GB-aligned RAM stays GB-aligned

2 GB of RAM with a tiny fixed hole just above the 1 GB boundary should
not produce a sub-GB RAM fragment:

| Input | Range |
|---|---|
| RAM request | 2 GB, 1 GB alignment |
| Fixed MMIO | `0x4010_0000..0x4020_0000` |

| Output | Range |
|---|---|
| RAM | `0x0000_0000..0x4000_0000` |
| Fixed MMIO | `0x4010_0000..0x4020_0000` |
| RAM | `0x8000_0000..0xC000_0000` |

The splitter places one full 1 GB chunk, refuses to use the interrupted
sub-GB fragment, and resumes at the next 1 GB boundary.

### Small NUMA nodes use 2 MB alignment

Two 512 MB NUMA nodes:

| Input | Size |
|---|---|
| vnode 0 RAM | 512 MB |
| vnode 1 RAM | 512 MB |

| Output | Range |
|---|---|
| vnode 0 RAM | `0x0000_0000..0x2000_0000` |
| vnode 1 RAM | `0x2000_0000..0x4000_0000` |

With 1 GB alignment each node would burn a full GB of address space.
Request order is the vnode assignment, so swapping the requests swaps the
NUMA layout.

### VTL2 does not move VTL0

Starting from 2 GB of VTL0 RAM and a fixed 1 GB MMIO hole:

| VTL0 output | Range |
|---|---|
| RAM | `0x0000_0000..0x4000_0000` |
| MMIO | `0x4000_0000..0x8000_0000` |
| RAM | `0x8000_0000..0xC000_0000` |

Adding a 2 MB VTL2 private-memory request leaves the VTL0 layout
identical and places VTL2 after the VTL0-visible top:

| Private output | Range |
|---|---|
| VTL2 | `0xC000_0000..0xC020_0000` |

`MemoryLayout::end_of_layout()` reports the top of all stored ranges,
including VTL2 chipset MMIO when present.
`MemoryLayout::vtl2_range()` reports the VTL2 private memory range
separately.

### Reserved holes do not raise the layout top

A reserved range blocks allocation but is not a guest-visible resource,
so it does not push later post-MMIO ranges higher:

| Input | Range |
|---|---|
| RAM request | 2 GB |
| Reserved hole | `0xFD_0000_0000..0xFD_4000_0000` |
| Post-MMIO request | 1 MB |

| Output | Range |
|---|---|
| RAM | `0x0000_0000..0x8000_0000` |
| Post-MMIO | `0x8000_0000..0x8010_0000` |

Trailing reserved ranges are omitted from the returned allocation list,
but a reserved range that sits between real allocations is reported so
callers can see the full occupied map.
