# gRPC / ttrpc

To enable a gRPC or ttrpc management interface, pass `--rpc`. This spawns an
OpenVMM process acting as an RPC server on the given Unix socket:

```bash
--rpc path=/path/to/openvmm.sock[,transport=<TRANSPORT>]
```

`transport` selects which wire protocol the server accepts:

* `auto` (default) — auto-detect ttrpc vs. gRPC per connection
* `ttrpc` — accept ttrpc clients only
* `grpc` — accept gRPC clients only

For example, to accept ttrpc clients only:

```bash
--rpc path=/path/to/openvmm.sock,transport=ttrpc
```

Here is a list of supported RPCs:

The API continues to evolve, and compatibility between releases is not
guaranteed. The [`vmservice.proto`] file is the authoritative API definition.
The list below summarizes the available RPCs; some definitions may be added
before their implementation is connected end to end.
